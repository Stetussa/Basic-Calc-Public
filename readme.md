## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

BasicCalc is a basic calculator program that is coded in Python and uses Tkinter for it's GUI. BasicCalc's code was
written specifically with learning the basics of Python and Tkinter in mind and so the code contains comprehensive

those wanting to learn the basics of Python and especially Tkinter.
